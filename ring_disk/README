* Introduction
In Dev do not use on prod. Not yet completed missing the disk rebuild part.


* Latest version 
The latest code is in funcreplacedisk.sh which is written with function to be merged with ssacli code.

It can be run as a full replacement : 
''
./funcreplacedisk.sh all scality g1disk01
''

or run in invididual steps see the script helper :
''
./funcreplacedisk.sh <operation> <target disk path> <disk name>
example : ./funcreplacedisk.sh backup scality g1disk01 
Args are : 
prepare   -> stop and get the disk ready to be replaced 
backup    -> backup the disk content to /var/tmp/dumpdisk/ 
rebuild   -> Rebuild the disk 
restore   -> Restore disk content
all       -> run all the steps

''


* Older version 
replacedisk.sh is the former version with a bunch of tools to ease testing.

Tool use to replace/rebuild scality disk in place.
It could be used to reformat local drive if wrong setting is set on the LUN

There is a "VM" option to run the tool on AWS machines.
The RUN variable is to prevent destructive action 

The disk must be marked with a witness file before hand.
''
for i in $(ls -d /scality/*disk*) ; do  d=$( echo $i | cut -d '/' -f 3) ; touch $i/.$d ; done
ls /scality/*disk*/.*disk*
''

Can stop / start the device..

''
backupdrive.sh
''

** side scripts for testing
